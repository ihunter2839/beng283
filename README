To run the script:

python q3.py [candidate proteins file] [MS data.mgf file]

Script creates file idealSpectrums.txt that contains the 
m/z values of the ideal spectrums generated for the two 
candidate peptides within the tolerated mass accuracy range. 

Output of script:
Parent mass: [mass of precursor ion]

[Candidate peptide]
[0123456789] = sum of (m/z * normed intensity value) for all m/z values
    explained by ideal spectrum
[0123456789] = sum of explained m/z values
[0123456789] = sum of explained normed intensity values
[0123456789] = # explained m/z values / total # m/z values
